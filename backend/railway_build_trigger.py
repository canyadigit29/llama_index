Railway Build Trigger File

This file exists solely to trigger Railway builds when no other backend files have changed.
If Railway reports "No changed files matched patterns: backend/**", make a simple edit to this file
(like changing the version number below) and commit the change.

Version: 1.0.4
Last update: Fixed Supabase auth token issue and improved bucket handling

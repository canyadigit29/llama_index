# Fix for Supabase client issue

This update addresses the error related to the Supabase client initialization in the Railway deployment:

1. Fixed the Supabase client initialization code in `main.py` with better error handling and compatibility with different versions of the supabase library.

2. Updated the requirements.txt to use a version of the supabase library that works properly with our code.

To deploy these changes to Railway:

1. Commit these changes to your Git repository
2. Push to the branch that Railway is deploying from
3. Railway should automatically detect the changes and redeploy

Once deployed, the error "Failed to initialize Supabase client: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy'" should be resolved.
